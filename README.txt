This Solidity smart contract implements a simple decentralized lottery system on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to participate in a lottery by sending a fixed amount of ether. The manager of the lottery can pick a winner and distribute the prize based on predefined rules.

Key Features
  Player Participation: Users can join the lottery by sending exactly 0.1 ether to the contract. The contract stores the addresses of all 
  participants.
  Manager Controls: The contract has a manager (the creator of the contract) who oversees the lottery, checks the balance, and picks the 
  winner.
  Random Winner Selection: A pseudo-random number is generated to select the winner. The method used is not truly random and should be 
  replaced with a secure randomness source (e.g., an oracle) in production.
  Prize Distribution: The winner receives 90% of the contract's balance, and the manager receives a 10% fee. After selecting the winner, the 
  lottery is reset for the next round.

Key Functions
  receive(): Allows players to enter the lottery by sending exactly 0.1 ether.
  getBalance(): Returns the current balance of the contract; only the manager can call this function.
  random(): Generates a pseudo-random number based on blockchain data.
  pickWinner(): Selects a winner randomly, distributes the prize, and resets the lottery; only the manager can call this function.

Usage
This contract provides a simple and transparent way to run a lottery on the blockchain. It ensures fairness by using the Ethereum blockchain's immutability to record all entries and distribute the prize according to predefined rules. However, note that the random number generation is not secure and should be improved for use in a real-world application.
